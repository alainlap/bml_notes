# POSITIONING

display:block = This makes the element a block box. It won't let anything sit next to it on the page! It takes up the full width.

display:inline-block = This makes the element a block box, but will allow other elements to sit next to it on the same line.

display:inline = This makes the element sit on the same line as another element, but without formatting it like a block. It only takes up as much width as it needs (not the whole line).

display:none = This makes the element and its content disappear from the page entirely!

float:right/left = 

clear:right/left/both = get out of the way of floating objections on the right/left/both sides

position:absolute = positioned in relation to the first parent element it has that doesn't have position:static. If there's no such element, the element with position:absolute gets positioned relative to <html>.

position:relative =  move relative to where it would have landed if it just had the default static positioning.

position:static = 


# MARGIN/BORDER/PADDING

margin: Top Right Bottom Left;
